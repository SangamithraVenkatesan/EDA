## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This repository is dedicated to Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), an essential process for understanding and visualizing datasets. The project uses structured data to uncover patterns, detect anomalies, and frame hypotheses, laying a foundation for subsequent machine learning or decision-making tasks.

## Files
exploratory-data-analysis-eda.ipynb

A comprehensive Jupyter Notebook for performing EDA.
Includes cleaning, visualization, and statistical insights.
train.csv

The main dataset used for analysis. Contains features and labeled outcomes.
test.csv

A secondary dataset used for validation and predictions.
gender_submission.csv

A sample file illustrating submission formatting for predictions.
## Key Recommendations
1. Clean Your Data
Handle missing or null values by imputation or removal.
Remove duplicate entries to maintain data integrity.
2. Visualize Data Distributions
Use histograms and box plots to understand feature distributions.
Look for outliers and skewness that might affect analysis.
3. Analyze Relationships
Leverage scatter plots and heatmaps to find correlations.
Focus on significant variables that drive outcomes.
4. Prepare for Modeling
Standardize numerical features and encode categorical ones.
Split datasets appropriately for training and validation.

## Project Highlights
1. Data Cleaning:
Detect and address inconsistencies, missing values, and anomalies.

2. Descriptive Statistics:
Gain insights through mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and correlations.

3. Visualization:
Generate intuitive charts to better understand data trends and relationships.
